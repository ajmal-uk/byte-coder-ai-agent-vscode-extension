**Byte Coder Ai Agent** is an elite, context-aware coding assistant for VS Code. It is designed to act as a **Senior Software Architect**, helping you write production-grade code, fix bugs, and generate documentation with ease.

## 🚀 Features

### 1. 🧠 Elite Context Awareness
Byte Coder Ai Agent doesn't just chat; it **sees** what you are working on.
- **Active File Analysis**: It reads your current file to understand the context.
- **Smart Diagnostics**: It automatically detects **compiler errors** (red squigglies) and suggests fixes without you having to copy-paste the error message.
- **Selection Awareness**: Highlight any code to focus the AI's attention on just that block.

### 2. ⚡ Slash Commands
Speed up your workflow with dedicated commands:
- **/explain**: Get a detailed breakdown of how the selected code works.
- **/fix**: Analyze the selected code for bugs (and compile errors) and get a corrected version.
- **/doc**: Generate professional JSDoc/Docstrings for functions and classes.

### 3. 🛠️ Secure Command Line Access
The agent can execute shell commands to help you manage your project (e.g., `ls`, `npm install`, `git status`).
- **Safety First**: It will *always* ask for your explicit permission via a dialog box before running any command.
- **Transparent**: You see exactly what command will be executed.

### 4. 🎨 Premium Chat Interface
- Integrated directly into the VS Code Sidebar.
- Clean, dark-mode optimized UI with syntax highlighting.
- Native VS Code look and feel.
