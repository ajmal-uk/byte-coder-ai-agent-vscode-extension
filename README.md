## ⚡ What is Byte Coder AI?

**Byte Coder Ai Agent** is not just another chatbot. It is a **context-aware Senior Software Architect** living inside your editor. 

Whether you are a **Student** learning to code or a **Pro** building complex systems, Byte Coder adapts to you. It reads your files, understands your selection, and even sees your compilation errors automatically.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧠 1. Deep Context Awareness
Stop copy-pasting code into ChatGPT. Byte Coder **sees what you see**.
- **Active File Analysis**: Instantly provides answers based on your current file.
- **Smart Selection**: Highlight any code block, ask a question, and get a precise answer.
- **Error Hunter**: See a red squiggly line? Byte Coder sees it too and can fix it instantly.

### 🛠️ 2. Powerful Slash Commands
Streamline your workflow with dedicated commands:
- **/fix**: Detects bugs and errors in your selection and rewrites it perfectly.
- **/explain**: Breaks down complex logic into simple, understandable English.
- **/doc**: Generates professional JSDoc / Docstrings for your functions.

### 💻 3. Secure Terminal Access
Need to run a command? Byte Coder can handle the terminal for you.
- **Efficiency**: Chains multiple commands (e.g., `git add . && git commit`).
- **Safety First**: **NEVER** runs a command without your explicit click. You are always in control.

### 🎨 4. Premium Experience
- **"App-Like" UI**: A beautiful, dark-mode optimized interface that feels like a native part of VS Code.
- **Sidekick Mode**: Dock it to the right sidebar for a true "Pair Programmer" experience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1.  **Install**: Click the "Install" button above.
2.  **Open**: Click the **Byte AI** icon in the sidebar (or run `View: Open View`).
3.  **Chat**: Just type!
    - *"How do I refactor this to be async?"*
    - *"Create a React component for a login form"*
    - *"Explain why this code is failing"*

## 💡 Pro Tips for Students & Devs

- **For Students**: Ask *"Explain this concept like I'm 5"*. The AI will switch to "Teacher Mode".
- **For Pros**: Ask *"Refactor for performance"*. The AI will switch to "Architect Mode".

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Your Code**: Is only sent to the AI processing engine when you explicitly chat.
- **Your Terminal**: Is strictly locked. The AI can *propose* commands, but only **YOU** can execute them.
